## FAQ

Why the alternative?

It is simply to provide a way to enter data for multi-value fields in a similar fashion to what is offered via the Drupal Field UI. The advantage of the module would be that you can see all the data up-front without needing to click on any tabs. The downside is that you can end up with a lot of scrolling. This module also provides better capabilities to reorder data.
